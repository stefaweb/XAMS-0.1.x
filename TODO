XAMS TODO
---------

XAMS GUI
--------

Here are the current TODO list for XAMS 0.1.0.

- Alias:

  Missing or wrong regex in "Forward Address". We can enter and validate caracters as ";" or others.
  Only email caracters and comma should be autorised to be entered.

- Spam Score Trigger:

  Currently, we have a definition for default values for the Spam Score Trigger in the Preference, Reseller, site and email account.
  Currently, all default values are "static".
  The goal will be to have the values taken from Preference -> Reseller -> site -> email account (if empty -> filled, if not -> no change).

- Alias management and email account delete:

  Currently if we delete an email account, the associated alias(es) stay in the database.
  The goal will be to have the corresponding alias automatically deleted from the database.
  Difficulty: deleting of the right alias part when we have one or more "multiple alias" defined. A nice regex to write...

- Database:

  A new option to have a count report of mail accounts per Admin, Reseller, Customers, 
  and site. Global total per section. Option: CSV export

- XAMS logs:

  A new option in Event-Log menu to clear logs in the database.
  Add user IP in the logs.

- Menu and link:

  #top when we click on a menu item or a link. Curently, the screen is refreshed at the same position.

MAILSCANNER 
-----------

- Mailscanner and SQLSpamSettingsXAMS.pm:

  SQLSpamSettingsXAMS permit to define alias to NoScan but currently the system do not manage multiple alias and "external alias".
  It's a problem of complex SQL request that I was not able to write.

  This doesn't work.
  -------------------

  SELECT      DISTINCT( LOWER( CONCAT( a.leftpart, '\@', d.name ) )) AS Username, 
              a.rightpart AS U_rightpart,
              s.spamcheckin AS S_spamchecking,
              u.spamcheckin AS U_spamcheckin, 
              u.name AS U_name
  FROM        pm_sites AS s
  INNER JOIN  pm_domains d
  ON          s.id = d.siteid
  INNER JOIN  pm_users u
  ON          s.id = u.siteid
  INNER JOIN  pm_aliases a
  ON          s.id = a.siteid
  WHERE       a.rightpart = u.name
  AND         s.sitestate != 'lockedbounce'
  AND         u.spamcheckin  = 'false' OR (s.spamcheckin  = 'false' AND u.spamcheckin = 'false')
  AND         u.$aliases  = 'false' OR (s.$aliases  = 'false' AND u.$aliases = 'false')
